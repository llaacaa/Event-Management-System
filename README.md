# Event-Management-System

Event Management System (EMS) – accessible only to authenticated users with specific roles (event creators or admins).
Public Event Viewing Platform – available to all visitors, without the need to log in, where all available events and their details can be viewed.

The primary goal is to enable event organizers (event creators) to create new events, edit existing ones, delete them, and monitor user comments and reactions, while admins have additional capabilities to manage users.
The public platform should allow visitors to search and browse all events, RSVP (if allowed), comment on events, like or dislike events and comments, follow similar events based on tags, and more.
